# Pokémon Better Crystal

This is my first ROM hack. I'm trying to build a Gen 2 game that I enjoy as much as I enjoyed Pokémon Soul Silver, my first Pokémon game.
The title is temporary; I have no idea what I'm going to name this when I finish it. 

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Obviously, this is a clone of the Pokémon Crystal Disassembly by pret. I used their [tutorials](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Tutorials) extensively to make this. 

I also used TheSmithPlays' [Pokémon Crystal Legacy](https://github.com/cRz-Shadows/Pokemon_Crystal_Legacy) trainer data and level scaling because I honestly think it fixes Gen 2's pacing issues.

Various features from [Rangi42's Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal) were used, thanks to the pret tutorials. 

For other pret projects, see [pret.github.io](https://pret.github.io/).
